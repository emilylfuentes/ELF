    <h3> I graduated from The College of New Jersey in 2018 with a major in Communication Studies, concentration in Radio/Television/Film and a Graphic Design minor. </h3>
    <h3> I am current a Social Media Manager specailizing in vertical content. I have worked on 8 Snapchat orginial content shows and have managed various social media accounts. Most of my work is specifically in sports and pop culture. I consider myself very pop culture savy and am passionate in pursing work in that genre. </h3>
    <h3> Editing has always been a passion of mine. I grew up editing fan videos and that lead me to pursue editing as a career. My love for editing and small form content has never wavered. I am passionate, hardworking and am always up for trying new things! </h3> </center>
